Guten Tag :wave: ,
I am a PhD candidate at the University of Waterloo supervised by <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fkerschb/">Florian Kerschbaum</a>
and part of the <a href="https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca">Cryptography, Security and Privacy (CrySP)</a> group.

I am researching the threats that arise when deploying deep neural networks from three perspectives: (1) **Privacy**
when the model is trained on private data, (2) **Integrity** when the model's data cannot be trusted 
(e.g., due to data poisoning), and (3) **Model Misuse** when the users cannot be trusted (e.g., due to deepfake generation).

My work includes studying privacy attacks against large language models fine-tuned on private datasets, developing defenses against data poisoning, and creating multiple methods for controlling model misuse. In collaboration with our group, I have also contributed to developing Secure Multi-Party Computation protocols for Private Information Retrieval and the Secure Inference of Deep Neural Networks.
I received a Master of Science from the <a href="https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/?lidx=1">RWTH-Aachen</a> (Germany) in 2019.

If you have any questions or would like to learn more about my work, please feel free to contact me. You can also find my work on GitHub.

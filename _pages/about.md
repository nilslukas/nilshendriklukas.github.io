Guten Tag :wave: ,
I am an incoming Assistant Professor at <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/">MBZUAI</a> in Abu Dhabi, beginning August 2024. Previously, I did my PhD at the University of Waterloo in Canada, where I was supervised by <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fkerschb/">Florian Kerschbaum</a>. 
During my PhD I interned at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/privacy-preserving-machine-learning-innovation/publications/">Microsoft Research</a> and <a href="https://www.borealisai.com/">Borealis AI</a> and I was generously supported by the David R. Cheriton scholarship.
In 2024, I received the <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/news/nils-lukas-receives-2024-mathematics-doctoral-prizes-top-honour">Mathematics Doctoral Prize</a> at the University of Waterloo and 
was nominated for the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-postdoctoral-affairs/governor-generals-gold-medal-winners">Governor General’s Gold Medal</a>.

<b style="color: red;">If you are interested in joining my group in any capacity, please fill out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-UWRsnoiWnS19NENnNgyJ9Lt3QHPYc5Jbc_B_l5rk-A/viewform?edit_requested=true">form</a> and optionally send me a brief e-mail at "nils.lukas@mbzuai.ac.ae". 
I currently have open positions for talented Master and PhD students with a background on ML Security/Privacy.

My research focuses on designing safe and reliable Machine Learning systems in the presence of untrustworthy
1. <b>Providers:</b> Confidential computing via Homomorphic Encryption & Secret Sharing.
2. <b>Data:</b> Mitigate data poisoning during training & prompt injection during inference.
3. <b>Models:</b> Protect training data privacy through PII scrubbing & differential privacy.
4. <b>Users:</b> Control misuse by detecting generated (mis)information with watermarking

My work includes studying privacy attacks against large language models fine-tuned on private datasets, developing defenses against data poisoning, and creating multiple methods for controlling model misuse. In collaboration with our group, I have also contributed to developing Secure Multi-Party Computation protocols for Private Information Retrieval and the Secure Inference of Deep Neural Networks.
I received a Master of Science from the <a href="https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/?lidx=1">RWTH-Aachen</a> (Germany) in 2019.

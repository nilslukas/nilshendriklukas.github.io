Guten Tag :wave: ,
I am an Assistant Professor at <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/">MBZUAI</a> in Abu Dhabi focusing on Secure and Private Machine Learning. Previously, I earned my PhD at the University of Waterloo in Canada, where I was supervised by <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fkerschb/">Florian Kerschbaum</a>. 
I interned at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/privacy-preserving-machine-learning-innovation/publications/">Microsoft Research</a> and <a href="https://www.borealisai.com/">Borealis AI</a> and I was generously supported by the David R. Cheriton scholarship.
My <a href="https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/items/490121a4-7f9e-4736-aa3a-3f0b3c20d44a">doctor's thesis</a> was awarded the <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/news/nils-lukas-receives-2024-mathematics-doctoral-prizes-top-honour">Top Mathematics Doctoral Prize</a> at the University of Waterloo and 
I was a finalist for the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-postdoctoral-affairs/governor-generals-gold-medal-winners">Governor Generalâ€™s Gold Medal</a>.

My research focuses on designing <b>safe</b> and <b>reliable</b> Machine Learning systems in the presence of untrustworthy
1. <b>Providers:</b> Confidential computing via Homomorphic Encryption & Secret Sharing.
2. <b>Data:</b> Mitigate data poisoning during training & prompt injection during inference.
3. <b>Models:</b> Protect training data privacy through PII scrubbing & differential privacy.
4. <b>Users:</b> Control misuse by detecting generated (mis)information with watermarking

My work includes studying privacy attacks against large language models fine-tuned on private datasets, developing defenses against data poisoning, and creating multiple methods for controlling model misuse. In collaboration with our group, I have also contributed to developing Secure Multi-Party Computation protocols for Private Information Retrieval and the Secure Inference of Deep Neural Networks.
I received a Master of Science from the <a href="https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/?lidx=1">RWTH-Aachen</a> (Germany) in 2019.

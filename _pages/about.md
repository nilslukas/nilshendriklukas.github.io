I am a PhD student at the University of Waterloo (since 2019), supervised by <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fkerschb/">Florian Kerschbaum</a>
and a member of the <a href="https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca">Cryptography, Security and Privacy (CrySP)</a> group.

I study the (adverse) effects of deploying deep neural networks in practice and methods that enhance security and privacy. A lot of my research has focused around provenance verification of deep neural networks through methods such as watermarking or fingerprinting. I am also studying backdoor attacks through data poisoning and adversarial attacks as well as their mitigation strategies. For privacy in machine learning, I conduct research on membership inference attacks that (partially) reveal sensitive attributes about the deployed model’s training data.

I received a Master of Science from the RWTH-Aachen (Germany) in 2018. My master’s thesis was on secure inference with deep neural networks using homomorphic encryption.
